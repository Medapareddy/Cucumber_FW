# Prudential_CodingTest

Approach:(BDD)

Created Maven Project
Installed all plugins which are required to run the feature file(cucumber framework)
By using Cucumber-Selenium(BDD)  wrote the test scenarios as mentioned
Mentioned the dependency jars in pom.xml and added few jars in the required folder
Can we auto generated test reports

Results:

Wrote code by following coding standards(Indentation, variables usage, method name, class names)
added two more scenarios which are not listed in the scenarios listed in coding challenge(Window handles, Verifying data on second window and managing)
All the test scenarios written are meeting the acceptance criteria.

Issue: As per the time constarints couldn't able to add more scenarios

What More Can We Test:

Can test the negative  cases 
Multiple locations weather can be verified
Upon navigation - Test can be performed on click of social networking sites(like., facebook)
Signup page can ve verfied - All positive and negative scenarios 
Sign-In page can be verified - All the positive and negative scenarios
Weather can be seen either in "C" and "F" - Can be verified
All the links that are placed can be cerified - verifying of data can be done
Upon Sign-In can be verified the sig-in user name

Steps to follow:
Create the Maven Project/Convert the project created to Maven 
Look for all the dependencies whether listed in POM.xml or not
Add all required jars 
Update the project w.r.to maven
Create the feature, runner, Step definition files
Run the pom.xml file
Run the feature file - cucumber
